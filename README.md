In this project, we will analyze RNA-seq expression profiles from subcutaneous adipose tissue of 22 obese women, collected before and 3 months after surgery (88 samples in total). Our goal is to predict the magnitude of transcriptomic changes in patients following surgery, given the expression profiles.

Scientific Question: What are the transcriptomic differences in patientsâ€™ adipose tissue before and after bariatric surgery?
